### Overview ###
Library Manager shows current library configuration state for all project configurations (e. g. Release|x64) and modifies Additional Include Directories, Additional Library Directories and Additional Dependencies with one click.

To use Library Manager you should define library pack files with configuration for each library. The format is:
```xml
<LibraryPack>
	<Library>
		<Name>fmt</Name>
		<IncludePath>fmt\include</IncludePath>
		<LibPath>fmt\lib</LibPath>
		<Condition Configuration="Debug" Platform="x64">
			<Lib>fmtd.lib</Lib>
		</Condition>
		<Condition Configuration="Release" Platform="x64">
			<Lib>fmt.lib</Lib>
		</Condition>
	</Library>
	<Library>
		<Name>OpenCV</Name>
		<IncludePath>opencv\include</IncludePath>
		<LibPath>opencv\x64\vc15\lib</LibPath>
		<Lib>opencv_calib3d410.lib</Lib>
		<Lib>opencv_core410.lib</Lib>
		<Lib>opencv_dnn410.lib</Lib>
		<Lib>opencv_features2d410.lib</Lib>
		<Condition Configuration="Release" Platform="x64"></Condition>
		<Condition Configuration="Debug" Platform="x64"></Condition>
	</Library>
	<Library>
		<Name>spdlog</Name>
		<IncludePath>spdlog-1.x\include</IncludePath>
		<Condition Configuration="Release" Platform="x64"></Condition>
		<Condition Configuration="Debug" Platform="x64"></Condition>
		<Condition Configuration="Release" Platform="x86"></Condition>
		<Condition Configuration="Debug" Platform="x86"></Condition>
	</Library>
</LibraryPack>
```

`Lib` and `LibPath` can appear more than once inside `Library` or `Condition` tags. There should be a `Condition` tag for each supported configuration. `Lib` and `LibPath` may be omitted if the library is header only.
`IncludePath` and `LibPath` can be absolute or relative to the current library pack file.

Library pack files should be added in Tools->Options->Library Manager options page.

To view current library configurations - right click on a project in solution explorer and choose 'Libraries...'

`I L l` indicator show current library configuration state - Include Directory configured, Library Directory configured, Library Dependency configured respectively. Green - fully configured, Blue - partially configured (if a library has multiple Library Directories or Libraries), White - not configured. Indicator not visible - library has no `Condition` tag for the corresponding project configuration.

Use `Use` button to modify project configuration to use a library. It will modify Additional Include Directories, Additional Library Directories and Additional Dependencies project properties with entries from library configuration xml file.
